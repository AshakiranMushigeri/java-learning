Syntax of a method:

modifiers returntype name(type var1, type var2)
{

}

A java method is a collection of statements grouped together to perform an operation. 
The syntax shown above includes:
1)Modifier: It defines the access type of the method and it is optional to use
Access Modifiers                                 Non Access Modifiers
public(visible to world)                         static
protected(to package & all subclasses)           final
private(to class only)                           synchronised
                                                 abstract
We can write two modifiers together because every word has a different meaning
Static modifier : for creating class methods and variables
Final modifier : for implementing the final classes, methods or variables
Abstract modifier : for creating abstract methods and classes
Synchrnized modifier : are used for threads

2)returntype: Method may return a value

3)name: This is method name and it is always written in camel case eg-nameOfMethod

4)arguments

5)method body: defines what the method does with the statements

Method calling:
For using a method, it should be called. There are two ways in which a method is called :
method returns a value
returning nothing (no return value)
When a program invokes a method, the program control gets transferred to the method called. This called method then returns the control to the caller in two conditions when:
--->return statement is executed
--->it reaches method ending closing brace
