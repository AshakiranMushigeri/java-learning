Java Learning — Practice Programs in Core Java

A collection of Java practice programs written while learning Java 17.
This repository demonstrates my understanding of core programming concepts, algorithmic thinking, and clean code structure using industry-standard project organisation.

🚀 About This Repository

This project contains beginner-to-intermediate Java programs, organised neatly by concepts.
It reflects my journey in mastering:
Java syntax & basic programming
Problem-solving using loops and conditions
Understanding of object-oriented thinking
Writing clean, readable code
Using IntelliJ IDEA and Git/GitHub for version control
Following a Maven-style folder structure (src/main/java)

This repository will continue to grow as I practice more Java exercises.
