# Static vs Instance Variables (Java)

This example demonstrates the difference between **static (class-level)** variables and **instance (object-level)** variables in Java.

## Concept
- `static int i` is **shared** by all objects of the class.
- `int j` is **unique** to each object.

## Files
- `D.java` → contains variables and methods
- `Main.java` → creates multiple objects and calls methods to show behavior

## How it works
Calling `increment()` increases:
- `i` for everyone (shared counter)
- `j` only for the object calling it

## Expected Output
After obj1.increment() -> i=1, j=1
After obj2.increment() -> i=2, j=1
After obj1.increment() again -> i=3, j=2

## Interview Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Q1. What happens to a static variable when multiple objects modify it?</strong></summary>

A static variable is shared across all objects of the class.  
When any object modifies it, the updated value is visible to all other objects.

Example from this project:
- `i` keeps increasing even when different objects call `increment()`
- `j` increases only for the object that calls the method
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q2. Why is an object not required to access static variables?</strong></summary>

Static variables belong to the class, not to individual objects.  
They are loaded once in memory when the class is loaded.

Hence, they should be accessed using:
```java
ClassName.variableName

## JUnit-Style Test Explanation

Although this project does not include actual JUnit tests, the behavior of the code can be validated using unit-test style scenarios.

### Test Case 1: Static variable is shared across objects
- Create two objects of class `D`
- Call `increment()` on both objects
- Verify that the static variable `i` increases cumulatively

### Test Case 2: Instance variable is unique per object
- Each object maintains its own copy of instance variable `j`
- Changes in one object do not affect the other

### Test Case 3: Static and instance variables behave differently
- Static variable keeps accumulating across calls
- Instance variable tracks changes per object

These scenarios demonstrate how static and instance behaviors would be validated in a real JUnit test environment.
